These are settings we've been playing with.

Please update them if you find that things need tuning!



Note that speed is measured in mm.s-1, power in %MAX.

Max. speed is 400mm.s-1 in "Cut" mode and 1000mm.s-1 in "Engrave" mode.



I find that over time using a laser cutter, any settings used converge to some fairly good pseudo-universal settings which have a reasonable chance of working on most materials.

For this laser they are:

CUT:      S=4.8  P(l)=66  P(c)=58

ENGRAVE:  S=800  P=40     Sd=0.06

# Cast Acrylic produces a frosted effect when engraved. Extruded Acrylic is clearer



CUTTING (Mode = Cut)
Laser Ply Cutting
NOTE: Other ply should be avoided.  It will not cut consistently due to lower grade and larger knots and will contain formaldehyde based glue.

Air pump will blow cut pieces around.

Keep the pump on but leave gaps in the cuts to break them off afterwards
